= Verify Connectivity to Neo4j from Spring Boot Application

The reason we should or might want to test a Neo4j database connection is because setting the credentials in the `application.properties` file does not actually test the connection. This needs to be done at runtime because they aren't config properties.

There are a few different ways to go about testing a Neo4j database connection from a Spring Boot application:

1. Write application functionality (domain, repository, controller classes) that utilize the connection.
2. Use a CommandLineRunner with the driver bean and use the `verifyConnectivity()` method.
3. Write a test for that uses the `verifyConnectivity()` method.
